# Statistical-Arbitrage
- In this project, we propose an ensemble algorithm comprising of three machine learning models: logistic regression, random forest and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks. Logistic regression facilitates baseline predictions, random forest enhances model stability through ensemble predictions (being part of the ensemble models family), and LSTM networks address sequential dependencies in price movements. Combining their outputs, the ensemble aims to increase predictive accuracy of the overall result.

- More specifically, we aim to train all the three models on the lagged returns of 30 cryptocurrency coins with the objective of predicting whether the coin will outperform the overall cross-sectional median of the overall coins in the next 2 hours. After training, the predictions from the three models will be ensembled to give a more accurate prediction value that will be used to rank the coins by performance in a descending order. We go long for the top 3 and short the flop 3 and reverse our positions after the two-hour period. We then evaluate the approach on the out of sample historical data and compare the results with the baseline strategies under consideration.

The proposed approach will be a robust application of statistical arbitrage within the cryptocurrency space. However, since the strategy relies on historical data, it might not be guaranteed to perform in a similar manner under future prevailing market conditions.
